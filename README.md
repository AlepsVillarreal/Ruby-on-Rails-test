Rails 5.0.0 and Ruby 2.3.0 are required to run this.

This is a website that enables investors to meet developers that can develop their ideas. It features a premium and a standard service for investor accounts and only standard for developer costs.

With the premium service, investors can actually see the contact details of the developers. With just the standard service, they can only see their description, location and related projects the registered developers have done.

Features
- Supports account registration as a developer and an investor
- Payment service supported by Stripe

It has predefined values for the user accounts. For this reason, it needs to seed the default values before migrating.
